# Assignment
1. On your top nav add a link that displays login if user isn't logged in and logout if user is already logged in
2. Implement functionality for logging out.
3. Introduce a 404 page. If one visits a route which isn't assigned that person should see a nice 404 page instead of an empty page.


Nice to have
1. clean up codebase
2. Make sure you are adhering to Dry
3. separate concerns


Good Luck!!!
